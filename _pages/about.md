I am an incoming M.S. student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I currently work as a short-term Research Scientist with Prof. Matthew Gombolay at Georgia Tech. 

Previously, I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I was a researcher in the [Insititute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines (IRIM)](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) at Georgia Tech where I was advised by [Prof. Ye Zhao](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) and [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). My undergraduate research focused on trajectory optmization through contact and multi-agent reinforcement learning in heterogeneous teams. 

Research
======
I am interested in intelligent robots. My research goal is to enable intelligent robot behavior in the real world. Currently, I am develping model-based optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms so that robots can act more safely and robustly in uncertain envrionments.
