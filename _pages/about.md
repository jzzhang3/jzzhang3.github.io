I am an incoming M.S. student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I currently work as a short-term Research Scientist with Prof. Matthew Gombolay. 

Previously, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech where I was advised by Prof. Ye Zhao and Prof. Matthew Gombolay. My undergraduate research focused trajectory optmization and multi-agent reinforcement learning. 

Research
======
I am interested in intelligent robots. My research goal is to enable intelligent robot behavior in the real world. Currently, I am develping model-based optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms so that robots can act more safely and robustly in uncertain envrionments.
