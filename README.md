## About Me
I am a third-year B.S. candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) with a minor in [Computing & Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/minor-computing-intelligence) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) expected to graduate in Spring 2022. I do undergraduate research with the [LIDAR Group](http://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ye Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/yezhaout) and [CORE Robotics Lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). I will be joining [Cummins Inc.](https://www.cummins.com/) as a Software Development Engineering Intern during summer 2021 to work on electric and hybrid vehicle control algorithms. 

## Research
I am looking for PhD programs in Robotics and Computer Science starting in Fall 2022. I am broadly interested in expanding the boundaries of robot capabilities through intelligent planning, control, and learning. 

My undergraduate research focuses on modeling and control of highly dynamic robot behaviors such as bipedal locomotion and hand-grasping manipulation. My work leverages both low-level dynamics modeling and higher-level controls optimization. My current research reasons through contact uncertainty during trajectory optimization and motion planning phases in robot locomotion problems.
