## About Me
I am a fourth-year B.S. candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) with a minor in [Computing & Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/minor-computing-intelligence) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) expected to graduate in Spring 2022. I am an undergraduate researcher with the [LIDAR Group](http://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ye Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/yezhaout) and the [CORE Robotics Lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). I am currently a Software Development Engineering Intern with the Dynamic Systems & Controls team at [Cummins Inc.](https://www.cummins.com/) developing control algorithms for the new electric bus systems.

## Research
I am looking for PhD programs in Robotics and Computer Science starting in Fall 2022. I am broadly interested in expanding the boundaries of robot capabilities through intelligent planning, control, and learning. 

My undergraduate research focuses on modeling and control of highly dynamic robot behaviors such as bipedal locomotion and hand-grasping manipulation. My work leverages both low-level dynamics modeling and higher-level controls optimization. My current research reasons through contact uncertainty during trajectory optimization and motion planning phases in robot locomotion problems.
