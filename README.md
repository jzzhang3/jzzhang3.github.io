## About Me
I am a fourth-year B.S. candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) with a minor in [Computing & Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/minor-computing-intelligence) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) expected to graduate in Spring 2022. I am an undergraduate researcher with the [LIDAR Group](http://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ye Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/yezhaout) and the [CORE Robotics Lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) advised by [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). My current CV can be found [here](docs/John_Zhang_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

## Research
I am looking for PhD programs in Robotics and Computer Science starting in Fall 2022. I am broadly interested in expanding the boundaries of robot capabilities through intelligent planning, control, and learning. 

My undergraduate research focuses on motion planning for dynamic systems through both model-based trajectory optmization and data-driven/machine learning methods.
